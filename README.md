# Website-Totality

### Description: This website is a project for self practice of tools like HTML, CSS and JS.

This project includes projects of a course 50 projects for 50 days and I have combined its four projects to make this creative and user-friendly website.
The code and design of these four projects: 'TODO', 'NOTES', 'MOVIES', 'PAINT' is written with the help of the course.
However, the code and design of the main website is solely my work.
